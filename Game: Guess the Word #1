# Description: This is a simple word guessing game

# Import the library
import random

# Create a list of words to choose from for the guesses

"water", "book", "stool", "youtube", "science", "football"]

# Optional: See the random word generated
# print("our random word is ", word)

# Create underscores to represent character spaces
spaces = ["_"]*len(word)

# Optional - Show length of the word
# print(spaces)

# Create a function
# 1. Find all the letter positions from the users guess
# 2. If letter exists in the word, then replace the underscores with correct letter(s)

# Assignment 1: Write a program to find those numbers which are divisible by 15 and multiple of 5, between 10 and 150

for x in range(10, 150):
    if (x%15==0) and (x%5==0):
        print(x,end=",")
    
# Assignment 2: Write a python program to print prime numbers within an interval

# select range of the interval

int1 = 0
int2 = 100

print("The prime numbers between", int1, "and", int2, "are:")

for x in range(int1, int2):
     if x > 1:                 # all prime numbers are greater than 1
       for i in range(2, x):
           if (x % i) == 0:

       else:
           print(x)
